# Encryption_engine
This Program encrypts text type documents into an 8 letter long code which then converted in to binary form(binary__.txt)
The algorithm uses random technique to extract out 8 letter unique code for each and every alphabet. This makes it tough for someone to crack the code.

future versions will support encryption of all tyes of characters including symbols.
