# Encryption_engine
This Program encrypts text type documents into an 8 letter long code which then converted in to binary form(binary__.txt)
The algorithm uses random technique to extract out 8 letter unique code for each and every alphabet. This makes it tough for someone to crack the code. And, the binary form is now extended to 16-bits long . One-Time PAD Technique.
At present, only encoder is developed.
FOR EXECUTING THE CODE, JUST COPY THE ENCODER.PY. OTHER FILES ARE FOR UNDERSTANDING THE ALGORITHM.

Decoder is expected to be released soon!

Now, it supports any type of alphabet or symbols. Even Odia language encryption is supported.!
