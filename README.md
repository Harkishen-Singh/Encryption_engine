# Encryption_engine
This Program encrypts text type documents into an 8 letter long code which then converted in to binary form(binary__.txt)
The algorithm uses random technique to extract out 8 letter unique code for each and every alphabet. This makes it tough for someone to crack the code. And, the binary form is now extended to 16-bits long . One-Time PAD Technique.
At present, only encoder is developed.
FOR EXECUTING THE CODE, JUST COPY THE ENCODER.PY. OTHER FILES ARE FOR UNDERSTANDING THE ALGORITHM.

Now, it supports any type of alphabet or symbols. All regional languages encryption is supported.!

Decryptor has been released. 
Some known issues of Decryptor are:
1. The Decrypted text does not contain spacing.
2. The Decrypted text is in form of a single line.

I'm working on the first issue,  whereas the second one would be solved by using the lining software, provided in the repository 
'lining-sentence'

Further, a GUI version of this software has been planned to be developed.
